            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Good documentation is written for the reader, not the writer. This sounds obvious, but most poor
                    documentation fails because the author wrote what they wanted to say rather than what the reader
                    needs to know.</p>

                <p>This article covers practical approaches to structure, clarity, and long-term maintenance of
                    technical documents.</p>

                <h2>Know Your Audience</h2>

                <p>Before writing anything, answer these questions:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Who is the reader? A new user, an experienced developer, an operator?</li>
                    <li>What are they trying to accomplish?</li>
                    <li>What do they already know?</li>
                    <li>What can you assume they do not know?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Documentation for an API reference differs from a getting-started guide. A reference must be complete
                    and precise. A guide should be short and lead the reader to success quickly. Mixing these purposes
                    creates documents that fail at both.</p>

                <h2>Structure for Scanning</h2>

                <p>Readers rarely read documentation linearly. They scan for the section relevant to their problem. Help
                    them by:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Using descriptive headings that state what the section covers</li>
                    <li>Putting the most important information first</li>
                    <li>Breaking content into short paragraphs</li>
                    <li>Using lists for steps, options, or requirements</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Compare these two headings:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Bad:</strong> "Installation"</p>
                    <p><strong>Better:</strong> "Installing on Ubuntu 22.04"</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The specific heading tells readers immediately whether this section applies to them.</p>

                <h2>Clarity Over Everything</h2>

                <p>Ambiguity is the enemy of useful documentation. Avoid words like "simply", "just", or "obviously",
                    which dismiss complexity and frustrate readers who are stuck.</p>

                <p>Be specific about versions, paths, and requirements:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Bad:</strong> "Install a recent version of Python."</p>
                    <p><strong>Better:</strong> "Requires Python 3.9 or later."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Use the same term consistently. If you call something a "cluster" in one section, do not switch to
                    "fleet" or "group" elsewhere.</p>

                <h2>Show Working Examples</h2>

                <p>Examples are often more useful than explanations. Show complete, working code that readers can copy
                    and run:</p>

                <pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/users \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}'</code></pre>

                <p>Include the expected output when it helps understanding:</p>

                <pre><code>{
    "id": "usr_1234",
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}</code></pre>

                <p>Avoid placeholder values that do not work. Real examples are better than abstract ones.</p>

                <h2>Keep Documentation Close to Code</h2>

                <p>Documentation that lives separately from code becomes outdated faster. Consider:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>README files in each package or component</li>
                    <li>Inline comments for complex logic</li>
                    <li>Doc comments that generate API references</li>
                    <li>Runnable tests that serve as examples</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When documentation is in the same repository as code, it can be reviewed alongside code changes. This
                    keeps both in sync.</p>

                <h2>Maintenance</h2>

                <p>Outdated documentation is often worse than no documentation. It leads readers to try things that no
                    longer work, wasting their time and building distrust.</p>

                <p>Schedule regular reviews. When features change, update the documentation in the same pull request.
                    Treat documentation bugs as seriously as code bugs.</p>

                <p>Delete documentation for features that no longer exist. Keeping it around "just in case" only creates
                    confusion.</p>

                <h2>A Checklist</h2>

                <p>Before publishing, verify:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>All commands and code examples work as shown</li>
                    <li>Prerequisites are listed explicitly</li>
                    <li>Version numbers match current releases</li>
                    <li>Headings describe content accurately</li>
                    <li>Links point to valid destinations</li>
                    <li>Someone unfamiliar with the project can follow the guide</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Good documentation takes effort, but the time invested pays back every time a reader solves their
                    problem without asking for help.</p>
